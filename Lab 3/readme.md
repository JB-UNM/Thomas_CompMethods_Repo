## Lab 3
### EPS522-03, Fall 2023, Dr. Eric Lindsey

This lab is all about fitting data using least squares regression. Eric challenged us to do it using the actual matrix multiplication but I didn't feel like it this week so I just did the easy method if using scipy curvefit. The second question was a useful reminder for how to deal with poorly formatted CSVs that use variable length separators.
